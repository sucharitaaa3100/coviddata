ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Data Analysis & Dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using Excel (for initial cleaning) and Power BI (for interactive dashboards and DAX-driven insights).
The analysis combines multiple datasets (daily time series, worldometer stats, and country-level details) to highlight pandemic growth, testing efficiency, and regional differences.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives

Clean and validate raw COVID datasets using Excel.

Build DAX measures for KPIs like CFR%, Recovery%, Active Cases%, 7-day averages.

Design a Power BI dashboard with slicers, maps, and trend visuals.

Derive business insights on global and regional pandemic patterns.
